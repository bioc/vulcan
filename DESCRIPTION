Description: Vulcan (VirtUaL ChIP-Seq Analysis through Networks) is a package
    that interrogates gene regulatory networks to infer cofactors
    significantly enriched in a differential binding signature coming from
    ChIP-Seq data.
    In order to do so, our package combines strategies from different
    BioConductor packages: DESeq for data normalization, ChIPpeakAnno and
    DiffBind for annotation and definition of ChIP-Seq genomic peaks,
    csaw to define optimal peak width and viper for applying a regulatory
    network over a differential binding signature.
